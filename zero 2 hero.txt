Checkout tut repo

Run sm4shexplorer via shortcut in root
	This will ask for the path to the dump of the smash 4 disc. Get this from SGS' lab here - QQQQQQQQQQ
	In S4x, go Project>options then set the 4 folder locations (temp, export, workspace, extract) to be the folders in the root of the checkout

	Open the 'data' subfolder in s4x, some things should be highlighted in green already, showing that there are changed files inside. 
	This means s4x has found everything successfully and we're ready to MODD
	
/************	
SKINS
************/
Now crack open Meteor, go to options and make sure it has the correct location for s4x's workspace. 
	With that set, you should be able to pick a character and see some custom skins in the list (eg Robo Mario). SUCCESS
	
Why not add another? On Gamabanana, find the skin you want, and for simplicity's sake pick one with a Meteor install link. 
	NB - meteor links may or may not actually open meteor. If they do, hurrah. if not, go to the link yourself and download the thing. 
	Unzip whatever you get until you find the folders called meteor_xx_yourAmazingSkin, then drag this folder onto the drop zone in meteor.
You should see a new item appear in the list of skins!

Now, we want to put these compiled skins into s4x. In Meteor, go workspace>MSL workspace>export workspace to S4E. It will warn you about backups, which hopefully aren't needed once we have git but idk
Open s4x, which will have all your lovely files in it. Project>Build the Mod, then wait for it to say done. 
If you have an SD card in, it will probably try to put the results on the SD card by itself, otherwise find the output in the s4x_export dir, marked with the current date. 
	To manually add files to SD, the 'patch' and 'sound' dirs shoudl be inside a directory called 0005000010145000, which should be in the root of the SD card
	
Run this on the wii U using loadiine.ovh as usual! If the things you changed work, push the changes, bosh.



/************	
MUSIC:
************/


If you have a nus3bank - add it to todds_modds\workspace\content\sound\bgm  ,entitled snd_bgm_CATCHYNAME.nus3bank

(nus3banks can be found on the web of a lot of video game music and a few other things)

Open s4x, go plugins>music. 
(file>load configuration? shouldn't do anything but worth it on first run)
In the BGM Management tab, hit add at the bottom of the list. 
Set a title for your new track, and replace the 'Main BGM' with CATCHYNAME. If it doesn't autocomplete, sm4music didn't find it!
	For ease of testing, recommend you hit Reorder next to Sound Test Order, then send it to the bottom of the list with the other customs.

In the My Music tab, pick a stage. Grab your song in the middle tab from the dropdown and hit add, then say yes when asked to add it to My Music.
File - save configuration, file>compile.

Build the mod in S4x as before! Your sd card should end up with some things in the sound dir this time.


/************	
WHAT ABOUT MY OWN MUSIC THO:
************/
To make your own music though:

NB you nerds may well want to streamline this bit

Get a wav of the song you want
Open brawlbox, file>new>audio>brstm
Edit the loop points so that the track plays an intro then subsequently has a neat loop
Save your lovely new brstm!

Drag and drop this brstm onto sm4shidspbuild.bat in the Music Tools/MakeIDSP dir. No idea what this bit of the process is about

In the Inject Into Nus3bank folder, run:
	
	python nus3inject.py <name of NUS3BANK> <name of IDSP> 0x0
	
(There's a sample nus3bank in Music Tools which you can use here. nus3bank is a container which doesn't matter much to us)
This will output you a new nus3bank file which you can put into todds_modds\workspace\content\sound\bgm , entitled snd_bgm_CATCHYNAME.nus3bank as before!
Then follow previous steps to add this song to the game and then to a stage or several.



oh yeah i guess python 2.7 is a dependency huh

/******************
RUNNING MODS
******************/

probably everyone knows this by now but anyway:
Put mod files on SD card
	The root of the SD should have a folder called 0005000010145000, which contains the 'patch' and 'sound' dirs from the built mod
Start wii U
Go to loadiine.ovh in the browser
Pick SDCaffeine + Kernel from the dropdown
Let it do a thing, then reopen the browser
Go to loadiine.ovh again if it doesn't do so automatically, and press A when SDCaffeine prompts you
Load smash!
